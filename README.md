# Krita Conversion Scripts 
_**Scripts for converting .kra to other formats**_

**\*Krita must be installed on system and added to PATH!\***

_folders scripts will create a new destination folder for each converted file (and it's original).

Other scripts will place all new files and originals in a folder titled "finalized_..."

_**To Use:**_

```
1. Place desired script in folder with .kra files
2. Double click script to run (alternatively, run from shell with python)
```
